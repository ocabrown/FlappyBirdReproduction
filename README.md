# Flappy Bird Reproduction (in Unity)

I followed a YouTube tutorial to create this, my first game, using Unity. It is a take on / recreation of the infamous Flappy Bird game.
I added extra components to the game after the tutorial finished such as music and SFX, clouds using the particle system, flapping wings animation, a title screen, forcing game over for the bird leaving the screen, and stopping the score from increasing after game over.

This was just the first step to hopefully many more games!
